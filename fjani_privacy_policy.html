        <h1>Privacy Policy for Fjáni</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 2024</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Fjáni ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Location Information</h3>
        <p>Fjáni requests access to your device's location services to calculate accurate sunrise and sunset times for your area. You can choose to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grant permission to use your GPS location, or</li>
            <li>Manually enter a city name instead</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Location data is processed locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or shared with third parties. We do not store your precise location coordinates.</p>

        <h3>App Preferences</h3>
        <p>The app stores the following preferences locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Notification settings (enabled/disabled, advance warning time)</li>
            <li>Display preferences (language selection, timer display options)</li>
            <li>Location preference (GPS or manual city entry)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is stored only on your device using local storage and is never transmitted externally.</p>

        <h3>Notifications</h3>
        <p>If you enable notifications, the app will send you reminders about flag-raising times. Notification permissions are managed through your device's operating system settings. We do not collect or store any information about your notification interactions.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Calculating Sunrise/Sunset Times:</strong> Location data is used exclusively to determine accurate sunrise and sunset times for your area.</li>
            <li><strong>Providing Notifications:</strong> Notification preferences are used to send you timely reminders about flag-raising and flag-lowering times.</li>
            <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> Stored preferences allow the app to remember your settings and provide a personalized experience.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All data is stored locally on your device using secure local storage mechanisms provided by your operating system.</li>
            <li>We do not maintain any servers or databases that store your personal information.</li>
            <li>Location data is processed in real-time and is not permanently stored.</li>
            <li>App preferences are encrypted using your device's built-in security features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Fjáni uses the following third-party services that are essential for app functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expo Framework:</strong> The app is built using Expo, which provides the development framework. Expo does not collect personal data from end users.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Operating System:</strong> The app uses your device's native location services and notification systems, which are governed by your device's privacy settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use analytics services, advertising networks, or any other third-party services that collect or track your personal information.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not share, sell, or transmit your personal information to any third parties.</strong> All data remains on your device and is never sent to external servers.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can disable notifications at any time through the app settings or your device's notification settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You can delete all app data by uninstalling the app from your device. Since all data is stored locally, uninstalling the app will permanently remove all stored preferences.</li>
        </ul>
